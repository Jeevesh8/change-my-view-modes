Okay, I'm talking about making the human race smarter, forever.
  <claim> Intelligence is at least partially genetic </claim> and <logos> therefore passed down by parents </logos>, yes? [Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)

<claim> So, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people (<logos> I'm against killing. </logos> Of most things.) we just limit offspring? </claim>

<logos> For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to. </logos>
<logos> Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create. </logos>

<logos> So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. </logos>
<logos> The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. </logos> <logos> A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population. </logos>

<logos> Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on. </logos>

  <claim> This would eventually make the human race smarter </claim>, and <logos> therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. </logos>

  <pathos> I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do </pathos>, but I'm just looking at the concept. <pathos> I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused </pathos> ... I know all that.

<claim> Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit </claim>, or etc. (<logos> If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one </logos>)

<logos> Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? </logos> Or <logos> maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that. </logos>

  <pathos> Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80" </pathos>

  <pathos> I wouldn't mind a smarter human race... </pathos>

<claim> EDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.** </claim>

I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**" -nikeson </quote>
  <claim> I suppose that's true, now.... </claim>

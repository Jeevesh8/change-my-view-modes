A8	Type 8 logos
T9	premise 876 920	it seriously strains credulity to begin with
A9	Type 9 logos
T10	premise 924 999	Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God
A10	Type 10 logos

A11	Type 11 logos_pathos
T12	premise 1116 1206	there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks
A12	Type 12 logos
T13	premise 1209 1430	Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving
A13	Type 13 logos_pathos
T14	claim 1434 1638	The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels
A14	Type 14 interpretation
T15	premise 1641 1815	Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt

T16	premise 1829 1862	why did they stay so long anyway?
A16	Type 16 logos
T17	premise 1863 1911	It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate
A17	Type 17 logos

A24	Type 24 logos_pathos
T25	claim 2508 2637	Them being stuck in a barn has nothing to do with Joseph being cheap and everything to do with his family having poor hospitality
A25	Type 25 evaluation_rational
T26	claim 2650 2698	Interesting, I was not aware of this perspective
A26	Type 26 evaluation_rational

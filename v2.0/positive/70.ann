T1 main_claim 0 129 CMV: The theatrical cuts of Lord of the Rings are superior to the extended cuts and should be considered the definitive versions.

A9 Type T9 pathos 
T10 premise 887 1030 The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better. 
A10 Type T10 logos_pathos 
T11 claim 1031 1206 Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.

T12 claim 1207 1381 The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor. 
A12 Type T12 evaluation_rational 
T13 premise 1382 1539 They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil). 
A13 Type T13 ethos_logos 
T14 claim 1541 1671 Basically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,** 
A14 Type T14 evaluation_rational 
T15 claim 1676 1737 I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard. 
A15 Type T15 evaluation_rational 
T16 claim 1739 1772 Books and movies are not the same 
A16 Type T16 interpretation 
T17 claim 1942 2000 I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR. 
A17 Type T17 evaluation_emotional 
T18 claim 2054 2137 I want to point out that I absolutely **could not** stand to read the LotR trilogy. 
A18 Type T18 evaluation_emotional 
T19 premise 2138 2150 And I tried. 
A19 Type T19 ethos 
T20 premise 2151 2194 I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow 
A20 Type T20 pathos 
T21 premise 2201 2324 I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot. 
A21 Type T21 pathos 
T22 claim 2326 2354 I loved the extended edition 
A22 Type T22 evaluation_emotional 
T23 premise 2363 2447 I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule 
A23 Type T23 logos_pathos 
T24 premise 2567 2653 the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time. 
A24 Type T24 logos_pathos 
T25 premise 2659 2803 I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games 
A25 Type T25 ethos_pathos 
T26 premise 2814 2909 these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore. 
A26 Type T26 pathos 
T27 claim 2910 2992 I *love* that the extended edition helped with this, especially in this situation, 
A27 Type T27 evaluation_emotional 
T28 premise 3001 3166 most of the answers to that on the internet before were "If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!" because nerds are like that sometimes.

T29 claim 3400 3467 As a book reader, I'll still be sticking to theatrical cuts though.

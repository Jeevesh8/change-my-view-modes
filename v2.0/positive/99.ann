T1 main_claim 0 95 CMV: If a child struggles to achieve in grade school it is virtually always the parents' fault. 
A1 Type T1 interpretation 
T2 premise 97 195 For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities 
A2 Type T2 logos 
T3 claim 198 343 IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population 
A3 Type T3 evaluation_rational 
T4 premise 347 461 With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s). 
A4 Type T4 logos 
T5 claim 462 559 A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting. 
A5 Type T5 interpretation 
T6 claim 560 671 I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child. 
A6 Type T6 evaluation_rational 
T7 premise 674 825 maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below 
A7 Type T7 logos_pathos 
T8 claim 830 925 I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children 
A8 Type T8 interpretation 
T9 claim 935 1006 One of the largest predictors for success appears to be not being poor. 
A9 Type T9 evaluation_rational 
T10 claim 1040 1128 It seems like fining poor people has some potential negative effects... on the children. 
A10 Type T10 evaluation_rational 
T11 claim 1131 1152 It wouldn't be a fine 
A11 Type T11 evaluation_rational 
T12 premise 1155 1213 since it would only be a suspension of "assistance" anyway 
A12 Type T12 logos 
T13 premise 1216 1317 And poverty is a formidable obstacle but many, many people come from poverty to be wildly successful. 
A13 Type T13 logos 
T14 claim 1318 1380 That cannot be a blanket excuse for poor academic performance. 
A14 Type T14 disagreement 
T15 claim 1381 1529 I believe the fulcrum of a child's development has always been, and will always be the parent(a living, mentally capable set of or just one parent). 
A15 Type T15 interpretation 
T16 claim 1532 1536 Yeah 
A16 Type T16 agreement 
T17 claim 1543 1733 my point is that giving money to people that have successful children is going, ultimately, to lead to giving money to people that already have money, and withholding it from ones that don't 
A17 Type T17 interpretation 
T18 claim 1737 1839 Unless you make the reward high enough to overcome the *reasons* that poor parents are less involved ( 
A18 Type T18 evaluation_rational 
T19 claim 1844 1877 that's going to be very expensive 
A19 Type T19 evaluation_rational 
T20 claim 1894 1984 there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children 
A20 Type T20 evaluation_emotional 
T21 premise 1989 2036 they're statistically dumber than richer people 
A21 Type T21 pathos 
T22 premise 2039 2127 Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence 
A22 Type T22 pathos 
T23 claim 2131 2324 It would seem that a better approach would be to pay parents to attend training on how to be better parents, rather than rewarding the ones that have just happened to figure it out on their own 
A23 Type T23 interpretation 
T24 claim 2342 2431 I think you're just being naive about actual statistical variation in native intelligence 
A24 Type T24 interpretation 
T25 premise 2434 2544 There's really no reason to believe that every person has exactly the same potential to succeed well in school 
A25 Type T25 logos 
T26 premise 2547 2675 A simpler explanation is that native intelligence is probably normally distributed, like almost every other trait people possess 
A26 Type T26 logos 
T27 claim 2726 2763 Native intelligence is the challenge. 
A27 Type T27 evaluation_rational 
T28 claim 2859 2918 a moneyless society would over time revert to fiat currency 
A28 Type T28 evaluation_rational 
T29 premise 2921 2971 Some people can do some thing's better than others

T30 claim 2983 2996 Nice exercise

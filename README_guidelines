Tags to include
Title
Source (link to post for reference)
Original post, root replies

<OP> xxx </OP>
<reply ID="xxx" delta="x" length="x">
ID is the username
delta = 0 if no delta is awarded to reply author, 1 if it is
length is the number of replies in the same branch after the root reply. If delta == 1, length = the position of OP rewarding delta with OP at index 0. If delta == 0, length = the total number of posts in same branch including RR.

Record length of reply tree until it ends OR delta is awarded

Non-user text (not the user's own words, like quotes from other sources)
Tag: evidence
Attribute: type="quote", "link", etc.

General notes
To avoid ambiguity over a delta not being awarded and the OP simply not reading a reply, I only took responses that the OP had responded to.

File names: system?
Maybe a system of numbers. I usually put a 2-3 summary of subject

Notes on psychedelic drugs CMV post
I aimed for breadth rather than depth, so I chose to record several root replies rather than a single response branch.
Based on a paper I read, I thought the length of the response branch (which indicates back and forth conversation) might be important. I marked the number of posts in a branch until it ends or until a delta is awarded.

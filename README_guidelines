Argumentation tags (listed in decreasing frequency of occurrence)
Logos (<logos>): appeal to logic. Keywords include if/then, therefore, because.
Pathos (<pathos>): appeal to emotion. Indicators include words with emotional weight (ex: terror) or phrases that induce emotion (ex: driving is dangerous).
Ethos (<ethos>): appeal to authority. Author often indicates authority through experiences ("I know driving is dangerous because I was in an accident), status ("I know about driving because I drive a lot"), or title ("I know about driving because I am a driving instructor").
 
Other tags
Quote (<quote>): users often quote the OP/other users verbatim. Tagged this specific example of dialogue for potential future use.
Evidence (<evidence>): background information that helps an argument but does not necessarily state a claim.

Notes
We tend to annotate as much as possible rather than just specific words. Some instances contain annotated words or clauses, but annotations usually include the entire sentence or paragraph, if appropriate.
It is possible for the same content to have multiple tags.
Completely untagged sections mostly contain fluff (ex: greetings).

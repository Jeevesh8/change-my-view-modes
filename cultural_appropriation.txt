So, I actually get a good amount of hate for this, especially since I'm a liberal teen who regularly browses sites with political/economic views similar to mine, but this is one issue that I just don't understand. <pathos> Why is 'cultural appropriation' such a horrible thing to do? If a guy wants to wear a feathered headdress that's Native American-looking because that's part of goth culture, why is that so offensive? </pathos> <ethos> (reference to a singer that does that exact thing) </ethos> <pathos> Why do we want to separate everyone based on the culture they come from? <pathos> I understand that this can be a sensitive issue, but please be respectful, I really want to understand.

So many people have already answered the headdress example; I'd like to chime in on the "dreadlocks" example which is considered by many to be ridiculous. I'd like to provide some perspective from a <ethos> black girl's point of view </ethos>. This isn't about dreadlocks in particular, but about the "cultural appropriation of black hair" in general, which would include dreadlocks. I know black people aren't the only people historically to have worn their hair in dreadlocks. I'm only trying to explain the basis behind the view.

<logos> In the West, white women are considered the epitome of beauty by most standards. <pathos> This leads a lot of black women to struggle with how they look </pathos> </logos>. Skin-bleaching is an issue, but the more obvious is hair-straightening (along with wearing wigs and hair extensions to "mimic" non-afro hair). <pathos> <logos> There's this whole idea of "good hair" that's pressed on little black girls (and boys too), where having kinky hair is seen as ugly, and having loose curls, wavy, or straight hair is seen as "good" </logos>. Their own mothers will force them to get perms it's seen so unacceptable among black people alone </pathos>.

Now, obviously, white people aren't the only race with straight, or loose-curly hair, but white women are the Western beauty standard, and that is usually the type of hair that they have. Hair can matter a lot to young girls. I can't say for me personally if I found myself more stressed about hair or skin-tone, but <ethos> it's an experience me, my sisters, my cousins, and most if not all black girls and women I've known have been through living in the West (the US in particular). </ethos>

Natural hair has been becoming more popular lately (meaning black women [and men] wearing their hair in afros, braids, dreadlocks, or other styles). <logos> It's either seen as "exotic" by non-black people -- "Wow, may I touch your hair? It's so cool!" -- or it's seen as weird, messy, dirty, and especially, unprofessional </logos>. <ethos> My mother used to wear her hair straight, then "went natural", and received negative comments from white co-workers/bosses/clients about it. So she either straightens it with a hot comb/flat iron, or pulls it back in a bun, but never wears a full afro </ethos>.

<logos> I believe the backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation come from black women and men who, when they wore their hair natural, were either singled out or admonished, suddenly see white women and men wearing the style, and because white women and men are the epitome of beauty, it suddenly becomes cool, trendy, and most of all, acceptable </logos>. <pathos> That leaves a bad taste in the mouths of the people who were put down for wearing their hair the way it naturally grows </pathos>. I don't know much about dreadlocks, but as far as I understand it, <logos> because of the kinky texture of black people's hair (and when I say black people, I'm mostly referring to African-Americans) makes it easier to naturally dread, while people with straighter, less coarse hair usually backcomb or do something special to make the texture more "frizzy" and "rough" so it can form dreadlocks easier </logos>.

<logos> An argument I see against it is that "But black women straighten their hair/wear wigs or extensions to look like white women all the time!". The point is, black women felt pressured to, either directly in professional environments or just because they wanted to feel beautiful in a society where they didn't fit the beauty standard </logos>, a similar reason to why some women get breast implants or, less dramatically, wear makeup (Not saying all women wear makeup for that exact reason, but it's a reason for many).

So basically the crux of the argument leans on whether or not non-black people wearing dreadlocks are mimicking historical dreadlock styles from ancient cultures or Hindu Sadhu, or are wearing them because they saw African-Americans (in the case of the US) wearing them, and thought they were cool. And I'm sure it's a case-by-case thing.

So I don't necessarily think "cultural appropriation" is the most accurate term for the dreadlocks issue--though I'm sure many would disagree with me--but it's basically offensive because in the eyes of some, they (the white people wearing dreadlocks) took something that was once considered "ugly", "dirty", "unprofessional" and made it "trendy", "cool", and "pretty" because of their privilege of being the standard of beauty in the West.

It's sort of a more historically <pathos> painful </pathos> version of <logos> how nerds used to be bullied, put down and considered social outcasts, but now being nerdy is considered "cute", "trendy" and "cool" </logos> . It's, I imagine, <pathos> bewildering and frustrating </pathos> to people who used to be considered nerds, as they were literally treated as lesser because of it, and NOW it's cool and okay?

<logos> One could say </logos>, "Oh, you should be thankful! Now you can wear it/do that thing/ act that way without fear of being teased or bullied!" But that really doesn't erase the harm that's already done.

With the hair thing, I imagine there would be a similar backlash if there was a trend of non-black people in the West with naturally straight/loose-textured hair wearing afros. Probably even more so.
In some cases, accusations of cultural appropriation is more like, <pathos> "You took this thing that was culturally significant, even ritualized or a symbol of honor, and made it a silly costume, and stripped it of its value, or even desecrated it" </pathos>.

In others it's more like, <pathos> ”You took this thing that was considered unacceptable, that I was put down for, and made it acceptable just by the nature of your privilege (of being the beauty standard), which means my expression of this thing holds no value while yours does, which makes me feel lesser" </pathos> .

I hope that helped.

<logos> The idea of "cultural appropriation" is harmful and divisive (and more than a little racist). But like many other bad things, it's a good thing taken too far. </logos>

<logos> The good thing that cultural appropriation takes too far is respect for other people and cultures </logos> .

At least some Native Americans <pathos> <logos> consider a headdress to be an honor -- something akin to a military medal </pathos> </logos>. It is not something that just anyone can wear. <logos> So wearing a headdress you haven't earned is offensive in the same way as wearing a war medal you haven't earned </logos> .

However, I'd argue that, wearing a native american headdress (which is an honor) is very different than, say, wearing a handmade Japanese kimono (which is mostly just a very nice Japanese garment). The "cultural appropriation" types say both are offensive, but I disagree.
